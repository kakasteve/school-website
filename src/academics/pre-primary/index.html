<p>The Pre Primary department this year is aiming to engage and empower children in their journey of learning by creating an environment in which children will ‘learn from’ and ‘learn with’ each other through pair and group activities. We wish to  provide an environment in which children will cooperate and work together to discover and make sense of the world around them by  observing, listening, doing, experimenting, sharing and definitely playing and having fun all along.</p>
