Mr. Satish is incharge of the clay club. In this club amazing claY modles are prepared.Students get to work on the Potters Wheel, the artifacts are then dried and baked which makes them sturdy. While making models like Ganapati or any other statues the different turns and twist techniques are introduced which helps to make amazing models. Playing with clay is fun , it gioves scope for creativity and the satisfaction of creation.
