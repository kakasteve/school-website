        Welcome to the Children’s Technology Workshop’s Digital Studio! We are going to have a fantastic session discovering animation, programming, and 3D CAD drawings. Since our inception in 1998, CTWorkshop has helped countless number of students grasp science, technology, engineering, and math concepts while emphasizing creativity, problem solving, and team work skills. </p>
        <p>
		The consistent yet seamless progression in the digital studio program of CTWorkshop was first implemented by Darryl Reiter in Toronto. Since then, the program has expanded to include children in USA, Africa, Singapore, Hong Kong, Malaysia, Shanghai, and Mumbai. The continuum of the program and robotics as a concept is exciting for children. It is an excellent vehicle for developing 21st century skills like critical thinking, innovation and communication.
		</p>
		<p>
		In each session students will be communicating stories through animation and will also be tying in Science, Math, and concepts that may go along with the ideas they’ll be making. We hope to take lots of pictures so that everyone can see what’s been made during the week.
        </p>
        <p>
        <ul class="ul">
Some of the projects that the students will be building based on their levels are:
		<li>Pivot animation:</li>
		<li>Stop Motion animation</li>
		<li>Windows movie maker</li>
		<li>Scratch: a gentle introduction to animation and programming, 4-6 sessions</li>
		<li>Google SketchUp: Math and geometry through 3D CAD design, 6-8 sessions</li>
		</ul></p>

        <p>Cooking can give children and teens a great sense of satisfaction and build their self-confidence. When children cook, they are learning many skills, including math and reading skills as well as how to work together. They also get a chance to practice motor skills and concentration through things like pouring, stirring, and measuring. Cooking is a great sensory experience that children enjoy. When they prepare by having the basic supplies on hand and selecting some simple recipes, we are setting the stage for learning and fun through cooking. Cooking activities are messy too! Children can pick up on our tension if we’re worried about messes. Then they could become nervous and afraid of making more messes and mistakes. If we are relaxed about messes and mistakes, the children will be too. If we teach a positive attitude towards trying to things and making mistakes, we are doing much more than just teaching cooking. So we keep dustbin, plenty of rags handy and a smile on our faces!</p>
        <p>

        <b>How cooking helps children grow </b>       
      <ul class="ul">
            <li>Learn about nutrition and increase their willingness to try a new food</li> 
            <li>Develop valuable self-help skills and increase independence </li>
            <li>Develop math concepts through counting, measuring, timing, and ordering events </li>
            <li>Work cooperatively with others </li>
            <li>Develop reading skills, recognizing symbols and words </li>
            <li>Learn to follow directions and complete all the steps necessary to finish a task </li>
            <li>Explore the world’s foods and learn about the customs of people from around the world </li>
            <li>Learn science concepts: temperature, volume, how something can change when it is heated, etc. </li>
            <li>Improve fine motor control through using hand muscles </li>
            <li>Express themselves creatively </li>
		</ul>

        Welcome to the Children’s Technology Workshop’s Gamemaker Guru! We are going to have a fantastic session designing, and perhaps selling video games.

Gamemaker is a software program created by Mark Overmars and allows novice programmers to easily program and create games, while allowing advanced users the ability to create complex 2-player and 3-d games. In each session students will be introduced to a sequence of programming commands to create games increasing in complexity. They are forced to create only non-violent games. They will create arcade and platform games, with the ability to add new characters, backgrounds, and sounds. They will be able to carry home games that they have designed.
