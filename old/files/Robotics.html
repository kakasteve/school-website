		<p>Robotics and Engineering  Design:Robotics uses a hands-on  learning experience to engage students in Science and Math concepts. Through  simple to complex projects using guided projects and curriculum, students  become familiar with force, friction, simple machine, Newton's laws ... A  simple experiment with running a robot allows them to understand speed,  distance, time, ratio, &nbsp;and much, much more.</p>
		<p>An early introduction to  Computer Science concepts through programming is imperative in this technology  world. From get go on day 1, the students learn to program from fundamentals to  medium challenges.Since 2008, Children's Technology Workshop, has engaged more  than 17,000 students in Robotics learning. Students work in pairs to support  strong spatial development and reasoning. Our facilitators are trained and have  a degree in Engineering or pure Science.</p>
		<p>		  Robotics, thus nurtures in  students, all the skills and concepts that can allow them to succeed, in  academics and beyond.</p>
