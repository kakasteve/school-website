			<b>Shishuvan believes that :</b> <br>
		<ul class="ul">
			<li>Learning is a shared responsibility between students, teachers and parents.</li>
			<li>Learning should be meaningful, relevant, and life-long for the learner and teacher.</li>
			<li>The school should feed the child's innate  curiosity, stimulate creativity and concern through actual hands-on, developmentally appropriate experience and reflection.</li>
		</ul> 
		<ul class="ul">
			All children can learn and different students may demonstrate learning in different ways. <br>
